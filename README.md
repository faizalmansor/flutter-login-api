# Flutter login with REST API

I needed the code to learn Flutter but there was no github repo for this helpful article:
- [https://mundanecode.com/posts/flutter-restapi-login/](https://mundanecode.com/posts/flutter-restapi-login/)

## Getting Started
Fire away and start learning!
```bash
flutter pub get 
```

Change line 8 in `lib/service/api.dart` to your own IP address. Make sure it's your real network IP
```dart
String _baseUrl = "http://192.168.0.151:9001";
```

Connect to your phone or turn on the emulator. You're good to go!
